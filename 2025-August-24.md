Starting My Journal from today , Yeaa !!
It's working right ??

Yes it does ! !

Feeling a bit tired today, had late lunch and been working on the goddamn github workflow setup and now its working fine.
Day by day my love for system design growing exponentially.
Anyway need to revise some probability concepts and few calc questions.
That's all for today bye!
