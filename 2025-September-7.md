Almost 3:30 am rn, I'm struggling with a dependency hell in my Solana fellowship assignment. I don't know what I should be doing at this point. Got some new tasks at my workplace and spending time on that also alongside helping a startup.

Incomplete college assignments, which I ain't even doing lol.
